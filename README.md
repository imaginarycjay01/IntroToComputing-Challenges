Note: I've been working on this for quite some time, but only now did I push it to Github, so expect changes in both the challenges and the final project. Some challenges were coded in a blank HTML file and were not implemented in the final project because I may choose not to implement them or I have already implemented something better. It's a bit cluttered because I prioritized creating the final project before working on the challenges.
